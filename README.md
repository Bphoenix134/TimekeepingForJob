TimeManagerForJob
This is a mobile application built with Kotlin using Clean Architecture and Jetpack Compose. The app is designed to help users track their work hours, manage their work schedule, and keep track of time with a user-friendly calendar interface.

Features
Calendar View

A calendar that highlights weekends and shows the current day. This helps users to quickly visualize the current date and their schedule.

Work Timer

A timer that can be started, paused, and resumed with the press of a button. The timer tracks the time spent at work, making it easy for users to monitor their hours worked (especially useful for hourly-paid employees).

Home Screen Widget

A convenient widget for the home screen that allows users to control the timer without opening the app. This makes it easier to start, stop, and pause the timer without navigating through the app.

Statistics Tracking

Users can view detailed statistics on their work hours, including the total hours worked for the month and how much more is needed to reach their goal. This helps with tracking work performance and hours for payroll purposes.

Architecture
This application is structured with Clean Architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns between the presentation, domain, and data layers. The app uses Jetpack Compose for building the UI, providing a modern and declarative approach to UI development.

Key Technologies:
